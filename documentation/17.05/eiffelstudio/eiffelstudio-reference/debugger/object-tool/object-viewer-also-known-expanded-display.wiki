You can either show the "Object Viewer" tool through the menu path
<code lang=text>
Execution --> Tools --> Object Viewer</code>

or pop-up the object viewer dialog by clicking the button ( [[Image:debugger-expand-info-icon]] ) located in the tool bar of the [[Object tool|objects tool]] and [[Expression evaluation|watch tool]].

This command  [[Image:debugger-expand-info-icon]]  opens an object viewer dialog when an object is dropped onto the button. 

Depending the nature of the dropped object, you can view it with one or more of several viewers: 
* '''Object dump''': dump a text representation of the value
* '''String display''': string representation
* '''XML display''': xml viewer
* '''Object browse''': browse the object, as you would do in the Object or watch tools
* '''Object internal''': display some internal data elements such as: 
** <code>class_name</code> 
** <code>type_name</code>
** <code>dynamic_type</code>
** <code>field_count</code>
** <code>deep_physicial_size</code>
** <code>physical_size</code>

{{note|The "string display" viewer is available for objects with a string representation, for instance objects whose types conform to [[ref:libraries/base/reference/string_8_chart|STRING_8]] or conform to [[ref:libraries/base/reference/debug_output_chart|DEBUG_OUTPUT]]  (see [[Debug output|Debug Output]]. )}}

{{note|The "XML display" is available for objects eligible for "String display", and whose string representation has XML content. The viewer displays XML in a tree-enabled grid.}}


'''String display viewer:''':


[[Image:expanded-display-default]]
