=Introduction=

SCOOP adds only a single keyword to the Eiffel programming language: <code>separate</code>. In any case in which SCOOP is not enabled, the <code>separate</code> keyword is ignored, and the SCOOP-specific validity rules are not applied.

In order to enable SCOOP processing in your project, you use the project settings. There are two mandatory settings. One of them is the option ''Concurrency'', and the value you need is ''SCOOP'', as shown in the section of the Project Settings dialog below.

The second setting is the precompiled library. This should either be '''base-scoop-safe''', or nothing at all. A precompiled library which is not built with SCOOP support will not work.

{{caution | When you use a precompiled library, the ''Concurrency'' setting for that library trumps whatever ''Concurrency'' value you have set for the project. So, if you use the "base-safe.ecf" precompiled library, your project will not be SCOOP-enabled regardless of the setting of ''Concurrency'' in the Target. Likewise, using the "base-scoop-safe.ecf" precompiled library always produces a SCOOP-enabled project, even if the Target ''Concurrency'' setting is ''None''.}}


=Creating a new SCOOP project=

== Step 1: Create a new project ==

Create a new project with the EiffelStudio new project wizard by selecting ''Basic application'' from the choices under ''Create project'' when EiffelStudio opens.
The created project will not have SCOOP enabled however (this is true in all EiffelStudio releases so far, but may change in the future).
Do not compile the newly created project or precompile a library if asked - it will just be a waste of time.

== Step 2: Convert the project ==

To enable SCOOP, you'll have to do some work on the project settings. Follow the steps in the next section.

= Convert an existing project to SCOOP =

== Step 1: Adjust Concurrency setting ==

Open the project settings dialogue (Project -> Project settings...).
Select your favorite target (usually there's only one) and extend the section ''Advanced''.

In there you'll find the setting ''Concurrency'', which should have a value ''None'' for sequential projects. Change it to ''SCOOP''.

In addition to the ''Concurrency'' project setting, it is recommended that for new projects you use [[Creating a new void-safe project#Project settings for void-safe projects|the settings that guarantee void-safety]].

== Step 2: Remove the precompiled library ==

Expand the node ''Groups'' in the project settings on the left.
If your project uses a precompiled library, you should be able to see and expand the node ''Precompile'' as well.
Right click on the item (usually something like "base-safe_precompile") in the category ''Precompile'', then select ''Remove''.

== Step 3: (Optional) Add precompiled base-scoop-safe to the project ==

Select the node ''Groups'' on the left, and then press Ctrl + P on the keyboard (or select ''Add Precompile'' from the toolbox).
Note that this only works when there's no existing precompiled library and when the node ''Groups'' is highlighted.

In the dialog that opens, select "precomp_base-scoop-safe", then close the dialog by clicking ''OK''.

== Step 4: Clean compile ==

Changing the ''Concurrency'' setting and precompiled libraries each would cause you to have to do a [[Clean compile|clean compile]] of your system in order to become effective. To do so, close EiffelStudio and reopen it. 
In the dialog that appears, select the previously modified project and then select the ''Compile'' action and add a tick to ''Clean''.
At this point, your project should be void-safe and SCOOP enabled.

== Step 5: Double-check ==

Before doing anything after the clean compile, check the warnings section. If EiffelStudio is complaining that some settings could not be applied, something might be wrong with the precompiled library.

To make sure that SCOOP is really enabled, you can insert the following code snippet somewhere in your code:
<code>
check_scoop (a_string: separate STRING)
	local
		str: STRING
	do
		str := a_string
	end
</code>
This should trigger a compiler error. If it doesn't, then SCOOP is not correctly set up in your project.
