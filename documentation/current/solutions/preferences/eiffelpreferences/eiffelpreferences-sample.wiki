==Compiling==

* Launch EiffelStudio. 
* Click '''Add project'''
* Browse to ''$ISE_EIFFEL\examples\preferences\''. 
* Choose ''preferences_example.ecf''
* Choose the location where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the configuration file. 
* Choose the target: ''registry'' (Windows only) will use the registry to store the preferences, ''xml'' will use a xml file to store the preferences.
* Click '''OK'''. 


==Running==

After launching the application, you will see a window displayed with 2 buttons. When clicked each will display a window showing the preferences, one is the default view provided with the library, the other is a custom view for purposes of example. The default view looks like:

[[Image:normal|preferences_example_normal_view]]  

The custom view looks like: 

[[Image:custom|preferences_example_normal_view]]  

In each dialog you can select the preferences and alter the values. 
==Under the Hood==

This example shows you how to achieve the following tasks: 

* Create preferences using the library supplied preference types and associated views
* Use the default widget for viewing preferences and manipulating their values
* Create a custom preference (a preference for storing correctly formatted directory path names)
* Create a widget to view and change the custom preference type value
* Create a custom manager to register custom types to the system
* Create a custom dialog for viewing all the preferences
