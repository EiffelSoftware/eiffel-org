== Interacting with software in other languages  ==

===C, C++, and Java===
With EiffelStudio you can encapsulate routines written in C , C++ and Java. This makes it possible to use powerful libraries written in other languages while still benefiting from the use of Eiffel for the overall design of your system.

It is also possible to make Eiffel routines available to be called by these languages. So, you can augment existing systems written in other languages with extensions built with Eiffel.

===Microsoft COM and .NET===
In addition to C, C++, and Java, you may find it valuable to use Eiffel with other technologies like Microsoft COM and the multiple languages of Microsoft .NET. You will find information about interacting with these technologies in our documentation specific to [[Windows|support for Microsoft Windows]].
