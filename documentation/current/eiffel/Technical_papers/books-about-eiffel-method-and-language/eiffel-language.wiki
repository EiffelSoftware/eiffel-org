''Eiffel: The Language'' is one of the foundation volumes of Eiffel technology. It was originally published in 1992, and reprinted later with updates and corrections. 

Because the language specification has changed since the last reprinting to incorporate new quality and productivity constructs, hardcopies of ''Eiffel: The Language'', although still available, will represent the bulk of Eiffel correctly, but will not reflect the latest important changes. 

Currently ''Standard Eiffel'', the successor to ''Eiffel: The Language'', is a work-in-progress and is available in its current state online (See ''Standard Eiffel'', on [http://se.ethz.ch/~meyer/publications/#PSTE this page]). 

The most current state of Eiffel syntax, validity, and semantics is described in the ISO/ECMA [http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-367.htm standard document], also available online.
