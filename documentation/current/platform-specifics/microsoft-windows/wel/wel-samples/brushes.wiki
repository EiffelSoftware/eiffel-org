==Compiling==

To compile the example: 
* Launch EiffelStudio. 
* Click '''Add project'''
* Browse to ''$ISE_EIFFEL\examples\wel\brushes\''. 
* Choose ''brushes.ecf''
* Choose the location where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the configuration file. 
* Click '''OK'''. 

==Running==
After launching the program you will see a window displayed containing three push buttons marked "Brushes", "Rectangles" and "3D". Clicking "Brushes" will open a new window demonstrating different brushes available. Clicking "Rectangles" will open a new window within which many different shaped and colored rectangles will be drawn. Clicking"3D" will open a new window demonstrating the use of multiple bitmaps for animation. 
==Under the Hood==
Each of the three windows that are opened from the programs <code>MAIN_WINDOW</code> inherit [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_frame_window_chart|WEL_FRAME_WINDOW]]  and contains code for generating their output. <code>BRUSHES_DEMO</code> redefines <code>idle_action</code> to force a re-draw on the applicable windows. 
{{note|. If <code>enable_idle_action</code> is not called, then <code> idle_action</code> is never executed. }}

This sample contains the following classes: 
* <code>APPLICATION_IDS</code>
* <code>BRUSH_DEMO</code>
* <code>BRUSHES_DEMO</code>
* <code>DEMO_3D</code>
* <code>MAIN_WINDOW</code>
* <code>PROJECTION</code>
* <code>RECTANGLE_DEMO</code>
