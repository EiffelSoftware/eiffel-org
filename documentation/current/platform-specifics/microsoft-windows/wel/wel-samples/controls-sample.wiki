==Running==

After launching the program, an empty window will be displayed. There are numerous menus in the window, each relating to a different type of [[Controls cluster|control]]. Each menu has "Create" and "Delete" along with a other options specific to each control. By selecting these menu options, controls will be created and modified as demonstrated in the above illustration.
