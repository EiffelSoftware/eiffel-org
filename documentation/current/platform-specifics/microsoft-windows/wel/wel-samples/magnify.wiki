==Under the Hood==

In order to be able to control the output of the sample, <code>MAIN_WINDOW</code> redefines many features from [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_frame_window_chart|WEL_FRAME_WINDOW]] . The feature <code>draw_zoom_rectangle</code> is used to display the output and <code>on_menu_command</code> handles the notifications sent to the window when a <code>menu_selection</code> has been made.

This sample contains the following classes: 
* <code>APPLICATION_IDS</code>
* <code>MAIN_WINDOW</code>
* <code>MAGNIFY_DEMO</code>
