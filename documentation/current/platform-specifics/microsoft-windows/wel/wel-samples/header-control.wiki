==Compiling==

To compile the example: 
* Launch EiffelStudio. 
* Click '''Add project'''
* Browse to ''$ISE_EIFFEL\examples\wel\header_ctrl\''. 
* Choose ''header_ctrl.ecf''
* Choose the location where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the configuration file. If you select another directory than the default one, please copy icons (*.ico) and resource files (*.rc) from the default directory (the one containing the ecf file) to the new one.
* Click '''OK'''. 

==Running==

After launching the program, a window will be displayed as shown above. By manipulating the header control, you will see notification of the events that occur displayed in the [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_list_view_chart|WEL_LIST_VIEW]]  situated below. 

==Under the Hood==

<code>HEADER_CONTROL</code> inherits [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_header_control_chart|WEL_HEADER_CONTROL]]  and redefines many of the `on_' notification features to display the output. 

This sample contains the following classes: 
* <code>APPLICATION_IDS</code>
* <code>HEADER_CONTROL</code>
* <code>HEADER_CONTROL_DEMO</code>
* <code>MAIN_WINDOW</code>
