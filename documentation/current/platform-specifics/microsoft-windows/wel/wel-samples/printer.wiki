==Compiling==

To compile the example: 
* Launch EiffelStudio. 
* Click '''Add project'''
* Browse to ''$ISE_EIFFEL\examples\wel\printer\''. 
* Choose ''printer.ecf''
* Choose the location where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the configuration file. 
* Click '''OK'''. 

==Running==

After launching the program, a window will be displayed as illustrated above. Selecting "Print" from the "File" menu will open a print dialog which will allow you to specify a printer and additional print information before printing the contents of the window. 

==Under the Hood==
<code>MAIN_WINDOW</code> inherits [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_frame_window_chart|WEL_FRAME_WINDOW]]  and the feature <code>on_paint</code> has been redefined to display the output in the client area. A [[WEL_PRINT_DIALOG|WEL_PRINT_DIALOG]]  is used to retrieve the print options before the printing occurs through the interface provided by a [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_printer_dc_chart|WEL_PRINTER_DC]] . 
This sample contains the following classes: 
* <code>APPLICATION_IDS</code>
* <code>MAIN_WINDOW</code>
* <code>PRINTER_DEMO</code>
