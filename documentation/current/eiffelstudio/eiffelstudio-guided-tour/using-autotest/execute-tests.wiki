In the previous section we coded a manually created test. The Eiffel Testing Framework will allow us to execute that test, or, in more practical terms, any set of tests that we select. But before we execute our test, let's take a look at what we will get out of such an execution.  

==About Test Results==

When the Eiffel Testing Framework executes a test, the result will be one of only three possibilities:
# The test is '''successful'''
# The test is '''failing'''
# The test result is '''unresolved'''

These possibilities are defined as follows. 

{{definition|Successful test|A test which has executed without causing and exception to occur. }}


{{definition|Failing test|A test which has caused an exception to occur during its execution, specifically during the execution of a target routine. }}


{{definition|Unresolved test result|A test which has caused an exception to occur during its execution, but exclusive of the execution of a target routine. }}


So, successful tests are easy enough to understand. The test executed with no exception.

Failing tests and unresolved test results both mean that an exception occurred during the execution of the test. The distinction is made based on the location of the feature that causes the exception. 

When we execute our test <code>{TEST_BANK_ACCOUNT}.test_deposit_01</code>, we know that <code>test_deposit_01</code> will make a call to <code>{BANK_ACCOUNT}.deposit</code>. If the exception occurs during the execution of a target routine (i.e., in <code>{BANK_ACCOUNT}.deposit</code>), then the test is considered failing. If the exception occurs anywhere else in the execution of <code>{TEST_BANK_ACCOUNT}.test_deposit_01</code>, then the test is considered to have an unresolved result. 


{{note|Be aware that some early versions of the Eiffel Testing Framework reported some unresolved test results as failing tests. }}

This behavior can be helpful to us as testers. A failing test indicates that there is something amiss in the target routine. The routine has not completed in a state that satisfies its postcondition and class invariant, or is dealing with an unresolved exception from some routine that it has called. An unresolved test result indicates that something is amiss in our test. Something went wrong in the setup or cleanup of the test or perhaps the test called a target routine from a state that did not satisfy the target routine's precondition.


==Test execution==

Let's return now to the Eiffel Testing Framework interface so that we can execute the test we wrote earlier. 


[[Image:Testing Framework interface 01]]


Here you see under "Tests" the project cluster <code>bank_account</code>, the test cluster <code>tests</code>, the test class <code>TEST_BANK_ACCOUNT</code>, and the test <code>test_deposit_01</code>. 


{{note|If you've been working along in EiffelStudio, and you don't see this display, then go to the View combo box and type in "class" as shown in the pane above and press enter. Later we will see more about using the View and Filter boxes. }}


You see that the "Status" of <code>test_deposit</code> is "not tested", and that the "Last executed" date is empty.

To execute tests we use the "Run" button ( [[Image:debug-run-icon]] ) on the interface toolbar. The Run button will run all tests by default. However, there is a list of run options that you can access by clicking the black triangle just to the right of Run. You can choose to run all tests, only those with failing status, a filtered set of tests, or only those tests that you have selected in the tree below. We'll cover filtering a little later. For now, life is simple, we have only one test so just clicking the Run button should execute it. 

The test runs in background and the Eiffel Testing Framework interface now looks like this:


[[Image:Testing Framework interface after run 01]]


It's pretty clear that our test has failed. Its status is now marked with the Failing icon ( [[Image:general-error-icon]] ) and in the box below the "Execution" tab we see that the status also includes a tag: <code>balance_increased</code>. To get a more detailed analysis, we can double-click the test in the "Tests" box. 


[[Image:Testing Framework interface after run 02]]


We see that <code>balance_increased</code> is a postcondition tag on the target routine <code>{BANK_ACCOUNT}.deposit</code>. Upon examination of the code:

<code>
    deposit (an_amount: INTEGER)
            -- Deposit `an_amount'.
        require
            amount_large_enough: an_amount > 0
        do
        ensure
            balance_increased: balance > old balance
            deposited: balance = old balance + an_amount
        end
</code>

we realize that there is no implementation here. So we add the code to implement <code>deposit</code>:

<code>
            ...
        do
            balance := balance + an_amount
        ensure
            ...
</code>

After compiling, we execute the test again, and view the result:


[[Image:Testing Framework interface after run 03]]


This time we see that the test is successful, as indicated by the Success icon ( [[Image:general-tick-icon]] ) in the Status column. 

==The start of a test suite==

Of course, we would not have had to use the Eiffel Testing Framework to find that bug in <code>{BANK_ACCOUNT}.deposit</code>. We could have just written a simple class to exercise instances of <code>BANK_ACCOUNT</code> and truth would have come out. 

The advantage of using the Eiffel Testing Framework is that the test that we wrote to cover <code>{BANK_ACCOUNT}.deposit</code> can stay with us throughout the lifecycle of class <code>BANK_ACCOUNT</code>. We can expand the <code>TEST_BANK_ACCOUNT</code> with additional manual tests and run them after every development increment to ensure that all tests that were once successful are still successful.
