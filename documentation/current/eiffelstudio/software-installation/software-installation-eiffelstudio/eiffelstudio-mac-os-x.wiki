==Installing the GPL Edition==

MacPorts is a tool that allows you to use many Unix applications on the Mac. We have created a package in the MacPorts repository that allows you to to install Eiffel Studio with all dependencies in a convenient way. First, install [http://guide.macports.org/#installing MacPorts].

Now simply type (from a bash [http://guides.macrumors.com/Terminal terminal]):
<pre>
sudo port install eiffelstudio
</pre>


When a new release of the same version EiffelStudio becomes available, you can upgrade like so:
<pre>
sudo port selfupdate
sudo port upgrade outdated
</pre>

==Starting EiffelStudio==

Now everything should be properly installed and you should be able to run the compiler. Simply navigate to /Applications/MacPorts/Eiffel''XX'' and double click the EiffelStudio icon.

Alternatively, you can also start EiffelStudio from the command line by entering the command '''estudio''' or use the command-line eiffel compiler '''ec'''.

If you are a new user to EiffelStudio, we recommend that you follow [[EiffelStudio: A Guided Tour|the guided tour]] .
