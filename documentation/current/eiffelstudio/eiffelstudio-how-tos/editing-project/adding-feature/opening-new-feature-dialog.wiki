* Click  [[Image:16x16--new-feature-icon]]  in the [[Main toolbars|standard toolbar]] . 
* Select '''New feature''' in the '''Tools''' menu. 
* Use the [[Diagram tool: Introduction|diagram tool]] : First, select '''create new client-supplier links''' by clicking on  [[Image:new-supplier-link-icon]] .Then, pick the class to which you want to add the new feature. Lastly, drop the pebble on the class that corresponds to the type returned by the new feature.<br/>
