By default, there may not be more than 10 items in the history of a development window. It means that combo boxes in the [[Main address bar|address bar]]  will let you choose between at most 10 possibilities. You can change this number. 
To do so, use the [[Preference window overview|preference window]] : select '''Preferences''' in the '''Tools''' menu. Then in the preferences tree, select the "Browsing tools "sub-category in the "Tools" category. On the right part of the window, a list of preferences will appear, including "number of items displayed in the history combo boxes". Click on this item and enter the new value. 

Click on '''save and exit''' to complete the change.
