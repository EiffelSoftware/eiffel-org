[[Property:title|Making the context tool independent from the editor]]
[[Property:weight|3]]
[[Property:uuid|895ca03f-b14c-e0c5-f3e7-6757b47f5bc3]]
By default, [[EiffelStudio Editor Introduction|the editor]]  and the [[EiffelStudio window overview|context tool]]  are [[Centering tools on a component|centered]]  on the same cluster, class or feature. It is possible to make the context tool independent from the editor. It has then its own address bar and can display information on a totally different component than the one on which the editor is centered. 
To do so, click on or select '''Isolate context tool''' in the '''View''' menu. To go back to the previous configuration, click on the same icon again or select '''Merge context tool''' in the '''View''' menu. 

You can also modify the [[EiffelStudio preferences: Introduction|preferences]]  so that next time a window is opened, its context tool will be automatically independent: open the [[Preference window overview|preferences window]]  by choosing '''Preferences...''' in the '''Tools''' menu. Select then the "context tool" sub-category in the "Tools" of the preferences tree. Lastly click on "Share addresses between the editor and the context tool" and set it to '''False'''. <br/>
Click on save and exit to complete the change.
