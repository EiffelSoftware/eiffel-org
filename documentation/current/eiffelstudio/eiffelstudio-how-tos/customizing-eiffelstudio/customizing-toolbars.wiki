It is possible to choose which button are shown and in which order they appear in the toolbars. To do so, use [[Toolbar customization|toolbar customization]]  windows. they appear when you choose '''Customize standard toolbar...''' or '''Customize project toolbar...''' in the toolbars sub-menu of the View menu or in the contextual menu of the toolbars (which is displayed when you right-click in the empty space on the right of the toolbars).
