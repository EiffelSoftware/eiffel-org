[[Property:title|Retrieving a project from a configuration file]]

If you have already designed a project and want to retrieve it, or if you want to open a project created by someone else (such as the examples of the libraries which are shipped with EiffelStudio), you can either directly select it from the list of last opened projects or use the '''Add Project''' button to open the configuration file. 

This dialog also allows you to select which target to compile and you can also specify your own location where the project will be compiled. The '''action''' describes what should be done and the optional '''clean''' removes the compiled files of a previous compilation before doing the action. 

'''Reset user settings''' removes all stored custom information about the project (but not the configuration of the project itself). For example last used target, locations where this project has been compiled, arguments and working directory.
