Eiffel provides ways to add debug code to features to help during their debugging. You may think of it as the well-known C construct: <code></code> 

<code>#ifdef MY_DEBUG_FLAG/* Debug code is here */ #endif</code>


The corresponding construct in Eiffel is provided by the debug keyword. It is possible to wrap code inside a debug clause like this:
<code></code> 
<code>
	debug("MY_DEBUG_FLAG")
		-- Debug code is here.
	end</code>


It is then possible to enable or disable debug clauses globally.

To modify the debug clauses status:
* Open the [[Debug Options|Project Settings]]  dialog. 
* In the '''Debug''' section, you can enable/disable the debug clauses. 
* Click '''OK'''. 
* You must [[Generating executables|recompile]]  your project for the changes to take effect. 

{{tip| '''Tip''': Debug clauses make it easy to remove all debug messages when finalizing a system. }}
