There are two ways a debugged application can be interrupted: its execution can be paused, or it can be killed.

Two methods can be used to pause a debugged application:
* The [[Pause an application]] , located in both the debug menu and the project toolbar. 
* Breakpoints, which make it easy to stop the application at a precise point.

To kill a debugged application, use the [[Stop a debugged application]] , located in both the debug menu and the project toolbar.
