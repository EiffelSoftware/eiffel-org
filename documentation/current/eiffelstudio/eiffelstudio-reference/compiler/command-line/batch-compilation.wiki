In order to launch a compilation without user intervention you need to specify the `-batch' switch in the '''ec''' command line, otherwise the Eiffel compilation will be blocked. We will present below a typical example of batch processing on both Unix and Windows platforms where we want to compile a project in both frozen and finalized mode, then to launch the C compilations. At the same time we want to save the output of '''ec''' and the C compilations. 

===Unix===
In a file called `launch_ec' you can have the following: 
<code>
#!/bin/sh
output_file="/output_path/OUTPUT"

cd /your_project_path

#Launch Eiffel compilation
ec -batch -config config.ecf -finalize -c_compile 2> $output_file

#Since only C compilation for finalized code is done
#Launch C compilation for frozen code

cd EIFGENs/target_name/W_code
finish_freezing > $output_file</code>


It will go the directory where your project is located and compile your Eiffel code using the `config.ecf' file located in your project directory and compile automatically the C code. All outputs will be stored in the file `/output_path/OUTPUT'.

'''Note:''' All output from '''ec''' are going to the error output, so do not forget to redirect the error output when you want to see the result. 

===Windows===
In a file called `launched_ec.bat' you can have the following: 
<code>
rem Launch Eiffel compilation
ec -batch -config config.ecf -finalize -c_compile > c:\output_path\OUTPUT

rem Since only C compilation for finalized code is done
rem Launch C compilation for frozen code
cd EIFGENs\target_name\W_code
finish_freezing > c:\output_path\OUTPUT</code>


It will go the directory where your project is located and compile your Eiffel code using the `config.ecf' file located in your project directory and compile automatically the C code. All outputs will be stored in the file `c:\output_path/OUTPUT'.
