|- 
| Critical stack depth
| Stack overflow detection: depth of stack at which execution will pause and ask whether it is ok to continue (only works in classic Eiffel).
|- 
| Debug output evaluation
| Display DEBUG_OUTPUT.debug_output for objects whose base class inherits from DEBUG_OUTPUT.
|- 
| Default displayed string size
| Default number of displayed characters of a STRING (increasing this value might slow down debugging).
|- 
| Default expanded view size
| Default number of displayed characters in the expanded view (increasing this value might slow down debugging).
|- 
| Default maximum stack depth
| Default number of call stack elements shown in Call Stack tool (-1 to show all of them).
|- 
| Delay before cleaning objects grid
| Delay in milliseconds before cleaning the Objects tool view.
|- 
| Dotnet debugger
| Which .NET debugger to launch.
|- 
| Expanded display background color
| Background color for expanded display view (default is white, change it to better see white spaces in displayed text).
|- 
| Generating type evaluation
| Display the base type of an object if enabled, otherwise just the base class (disabling it might speed up debugging).
|- 
| Interrupt every n instructions
| Number of instructions that will be executed before interrupting the execution.
|-
