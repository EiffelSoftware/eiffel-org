If no application was already running, this command launches an application compiled in Work Bench mode and stops at its first line.

If an application was stopped, it attempts to exit the feature where the application is stopped.

It is accessible through the '''project''' toolbar (  [[Image:debug-step-out-icon]]  ) or through the '''debug''' menu.
