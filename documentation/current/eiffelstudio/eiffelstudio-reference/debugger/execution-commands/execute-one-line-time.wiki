If no application was already running, this command launches an application compiled in Work Bench mode and stops at its first line.

If an application was stopped, it attempts to execute the instruction located on the execution line where the application is stopped. If this execution line does not contain an instruction, the execution stops at the next execution line.

It is accessible through the '''project''' toolbar (  [[Image:debug-step-over-icon]]  ) or through the '''debug''' menu.
