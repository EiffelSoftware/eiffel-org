While working on a project, you may want to launch it to see if it behaves as expected, and if not to find out where the problem is located.

There are several ways to launch the application you are working on from EiffelStudio:
*  [[Run a finalized executable|Run a finalized executable]]  [[Image:debug-run-finalized-icon]], where no debug is possible. 
* Launch an application and enable its debugging 
**  [[Run and stop at breakpoints|Launch and stop]] [[Image:debug-run-icon]] as soon as the application encounters a [[Breakpoints|breakpoint]]  
**  [[Run without breakpoints|Launch and do not stop]] [[Image:debug-run-without-breakpoint-icon]] when encountering breakpoints 

* Execute one step in the application 
**  [[Step into a feature|Step into a feature]] [[Image:debug-step-into-icon]] 
**  [[Execute one line at a time|Execute one line]] [[Image:debug-step-over-icon]] 
**  [[Step out of a feature|Exit a feature]] [[Image:debug-step-out-icon]]


Once the application is launched in debug mode, you can [[Pause an application|pause]] [[Image:debug-pause-icon]] it at any time to see its current state or you can [[Stop a debugged application|stop its execution]] [[Image:debug-stop-icon]] completely. 

All these commands are accessible either through the '''debug''' menu, or through the '''project''' toolbar.
