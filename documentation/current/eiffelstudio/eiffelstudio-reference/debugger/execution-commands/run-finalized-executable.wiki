As opposed to other execution commands, this command launches an application compiled in finalized mode. This has the same effect as running the application in the EIFGENs/target_name/F_code directory from a console prompt.

No debugging is possible with this command, but it lets you test the real speed of your program without any overhead.

It is accessible through the '''project''' toolbar (  [[Image:debug-run-finalized-icon]]  ) or through the '''project''' menu.
