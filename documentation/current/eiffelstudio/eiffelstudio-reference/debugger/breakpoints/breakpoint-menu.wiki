A condition breakpoint is a breakpoint in which debugger will stop if a certain condition is met. To set a conditional breakpoint use the [[Breakpoint editing|breakpoint menu]]  and choose `Set conditional breakpoint': 

[[Image:breakpoint-context-menu]]  

Once done a dialog pops up where you can enter a condition:

[[Image:breakpoint-dialog-condition]]  

The condition is a Boolean expression that follows the same rule as the expression you can enter in the [[Expression evaluation|expression evaluation tool]] . <br/>


{{warning|'''Caution''': if you enter an expression that is not supported or which raises an error during evaluation, by default the condition is considered as True (then the debugger will stop) }}
