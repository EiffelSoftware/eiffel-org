[[Property:title|Select the Compilation mode]]
[[Property:weight|0]]
The first screen of the wizard lets you specify the mode in which the profiled system was compiled.

If you have run a finalized system under the control of the profiler then select '''Finalized mode''' and click '''Next'''. On the contrary if you have executed the system in Workbench mode then select '''Workbench mode''' and click '''Next'''.

Clicking '''Next''' will lead you to the [[Reuse or Generate an Execution Profile|Second state]]  or to the [[Select a Run-time information record to generate the Execution Profile|Third state]]  depending on whether an ''Execution Profile'' has already been generated for this compilation mode or not. If no ''Execution Profile'' has been generated so far (which happens the first time you execute this wizard for a specified project in a given compilation mode) you will go to the [[Select a Run-time information record to generate the Execution Profile|Third state]] , otherwise you will go to the [[Reuse or Generate an Execution Profile|Second state]] .
