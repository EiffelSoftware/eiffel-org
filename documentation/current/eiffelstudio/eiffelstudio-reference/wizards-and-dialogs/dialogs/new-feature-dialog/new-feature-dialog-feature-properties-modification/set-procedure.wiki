When creating an attribute, it is common that you will also need a set-procedure for it. For example, for attribute <eiffel>property</eiffel> you need a procedure <eiffel>set_property</eiffel> to set it. This feature takes one argument of the same type as <eiffel>property</eiffel> or is anchored to it. The only thing you have to do with the feature wizard is check the button '''Generate set procedure'''. 
<div>  [[Image:feature-wizard-setprocedure]]  </div>
The feature that is generated in addition to the attribute itself is placed in feature clause <code> Element change </code> and is exported to all classes. If you have selected or entered an invariant, the precondition will protect this invariant. Example of a generated set-procedure: 
<div>  [[Image:feature-wizard-setprocedure-example]]  </div>
<code>
	feature -- Element change

		set_button (a_button: EV_BUTTON) is
				-- Assign `a_button' to `button'
			require
				a_button_not_void: a_button /= Void
			do
				button := a_button
			ensure
				button_assigned: button = a_button
			end
</code>
