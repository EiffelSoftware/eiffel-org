The feature name field is a text box that lets you enter a name for the feature. For help on how to choose the right name for a feature, see: [http://www.eiffel.com/doc/oosc/ Object-Oriented Software Construction, Second Edition] , paragraph 26.2. 


{{warning|EiffelStudio performs no validation on the name you choose. For example if you type a space in it, it will generate the code, and detect a syntax error only when compiling. }}
