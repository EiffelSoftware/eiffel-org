All actions taken in the diagram tool that modify a part of the system are immediately reflected in the Eiffel system. Following is a summary of these actions.
* When you create a new class, this is the generated empty class: <br/>
<code>
indexing
	description: "Objects that ..."
	author: ""
	date: "$Date: 2008-09-02 13:54:45 +0200 (Tue, 02 Sep 2008) $"
	revision: "$Revision: 74646 $"

class
	CLASS_NAME

end -- class CLASS_NAME				
</code>

* When you delete a class, the class file is removed from the disk.
* When you add a parent to a class, the parent is inserted in the existing inheritance clause, ''without'' any additional ( <code> undefine </code>/ <code> select </code>/etc.) clauses to solve possible conflicts. <br/>

	CLASS_NAME

	NEW_PARENT

end -- class CLASS_NAME				
</code>

* When removing an inheritance link, the entire parent clause is removed, i.e. including any <code> redefine </code>/ <code> undefine </code>/etc. until the matching <code> end </code>. 
* When creating a client link, a function or attribute is generated by the feature wizard. When creating a function, this code is generated: <br/>

class
	CLASS_NAME

feature -- Access

	f: TYPE is
				-- Client from CLASS_NAME to TYPE.
		do
		end

end -- class CLASS_NAME				
</code>

* If you choose to create an attribute for the client link, and optionally specify to generate a set-procedure and an invariant, the following code will be pasted into the class text: <br/>

class
	CLASS_NAME

feature -- Access

	f: TYPE is
				-- Client from CLASS_NAME to TYPE.
				
feature --  Element change

	set_f (a_f: TYPE) is
			 -- Client from CLASS_NAME to TYPE.
		require
			a_f_not_void: af /= Void
		do
			f := a_f
		ensure
			f_assigned: f = a_f
		end
		
invariant
	f_not_void: f /= Void

end -- class CLASS_NAME				
</code>

* When removing a client link, only the matching function or attribute is removed. Any additionally generated set-feature or invariant is not removed.
* When removing a cluster, the associated directory is not erased, but the reference to the cluster is removed from the configuration file. At this time, it is not possible to create a cluster using the diagram tool, only to remove one.
