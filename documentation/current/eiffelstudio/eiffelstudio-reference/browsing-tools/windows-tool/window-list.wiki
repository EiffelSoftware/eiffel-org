It displays all opened development windows. Left-clicking a development window in the list raises it so that it becomes the top-level window. Right-clicking one pops up a context menu.

The four first commands, '''Close''', '''Minimize''', '''Maximize''' and '''Raise''', are relative to the clicked development window. The last command, '''New window''', creates a new development window.
