The Move to Folder command  [[Image:favorites-dialog-move-to]] , located in the [[Organize favorites dialog: Introduction|Organize Favorites dialog]] , makes it possible to move favorite items (classes and folders) to specific folders. It is enabled only when an item is selected in the left-hand tree in this dialog. The source is the selected item that could be moved. You can select a different source item by clicking it in the tree, or by using the keyboard. 

When pressed, a dialog is popped up, that prompts for the favorite folder the selected item should be moved to.

Select the destination folder by expanding the tree and by clicking it. The top tree item, named Favorites, represents the root of the favorites.

Pressing '''OK''' moves the source item to the destination folder. Pressing '''Cancel''' discards the dialog box and does not move the source item. 

{{tip|You can also move items around by picking them in the favorites tree and dropping them where you want. }}
