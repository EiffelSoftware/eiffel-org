All development windows are composed of two major components, each of which can be centered on a given "address" (either a cluster, a class or a feature). One is the editor, with which go all the peripheral tools (including the [[Cluster tool|cluster tool]]  and the [[Feature tool|feature tool]] ). The other is the context tool, which contains for example the [[Formatters: Introduction|class and feature tabs]] , the [[Diagram tool|diagram tool]]  and the [[Metric tool: Introduction|metric tool]] . 

It is possible to either link both components so that they share the same address (allowing to immediately have extended information on the class that is being edited), or to unlink them (allowing to have extended information on any class while editing a class).

When both are linked, only the [[Main address bar|main address bar]]  appears, whereas when they are unlinked, the [[Context tool address bar|context tool address bar]]  is also displayed, since it might point to a different location than the main address bar. 

The [[Change data share mode|toggle data mode command]]  allows you to switch between both modes.
