Basic text view  [[Image:view-editor-icon]]  is the only editable view; this is why it is only available through the [[EiffelStudio Editor|editor]] . 

[[Image:class-mini-format-bar]]  
This is also the view selected by default when the editor is opened for the first time. 
In this view, most of the development objects are [[Pick-and-drop mechanism|clickable]] , except for special cases like assertions, anchored types, identifiers within a comment line... for which the [[Clickable view|clickable view]]  might be needed. 

{{note|The generated text is not editable, but it is compilable. This view is not available to .NET classes which are imported through by means of an assembly. This is because the assembly .exe or .dll exposes only the interface methods and therefore is no implementation to display. Such classes may be viewed, in a clickable format using the Contract View or Interface View. }}
