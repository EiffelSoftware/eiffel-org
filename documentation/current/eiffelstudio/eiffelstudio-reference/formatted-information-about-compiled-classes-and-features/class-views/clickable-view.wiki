The clickable view  [[Image:view-clickable-icon]] allows to [[Pick-and-drop mechanism|pick]]  every class or feature name in the class text and is available either through the [[EiffelStudio Editor|editor]]  or through the '''Class''' tab of the [[EiffelStudio window overview|context tool]] . 

{{note|This view is not available to .NET classes which are imported through by means of an assembly. This is because the assembly .exe or .dll exposes only the interface methods and therefore is no implementation to display. Such classes may be viewed, in a clickable format using the Contract View or Interface View. }}
