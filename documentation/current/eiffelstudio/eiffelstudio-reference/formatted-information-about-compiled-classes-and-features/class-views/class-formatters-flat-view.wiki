[[Property:title|Class formatters: Flat view]]
[[Property:weight|-12]]
The flat view  [[Image:view-flat-icon]] displays all the features for the current class, i.e. including both written-in and inherited features; it is available either through the [[EiffelStudio Editor|editor]]  or through the '''Class''' tab of the [[EiffelStudio window overview|context tool]] . This is also the only view where [[Breakpoints|breakpoints]]  are displayed. 

{{warning| '''Caution''': For classes with many [[Ancestors|ancestors]] , computation of the flat view may require a few seconds. }}

{{note| '''Note''': This view is not available to .NET classes which are imported through by means of an assembly. This is because the assembly .exe or .dll exposes only the interface methods and therefore is no implementation to display. Such classes may be viewed, in a clickable format using the Contract View or Interface View. }}
