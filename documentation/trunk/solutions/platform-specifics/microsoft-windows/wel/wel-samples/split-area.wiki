==Compiling==

To compile the example: 
* Launch EiffelStudio. 
* Click '''Add project'''
* Browse to ''$ISE_EIFFEL\examples\wel\splitarea\''. 
* Choose ''split_area.ecf''
* Choose the location where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the configuration file.
* Click '''OK'''. 

==Running==
After launching the program, a window will be displayed containing a pair of [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_rich_edit_chart|WEL_RICH_EDIT]]  in a split area. Clicking the mouse on the split area (between the two rich edits) and dragging the mouse, will adjust the split area and its content accordingly. 
==Under the Hood==

There is no split area class provided with WEL, but <code>WEL_SPLIT_AREA</code> was created for this sample to illustrate how new controls can be built when required. Redefining some of the `on_` features inherited from [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_window_chart|WEL_WINDOW]]  in <code>WEL_SPLIT_AREA</code> shows how the control over the contents of the split area is achieved.

This sample contains the following classes: 
* <code>APPLICATION</code>
* <code>SPLIT_AREA_DEMO</code>
* <code>WEL_SPLIT_AREA</code>
