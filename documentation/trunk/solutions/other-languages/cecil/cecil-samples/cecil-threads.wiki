==bank_account==

After you have done the appropriate steps to compile the example, you will get a `bank_account.exe` on windows, or `bank_account` on Unix. 

This program launches two types of threads:
* the spenders withdraw some money from a shared bank account
* the savers make some deposits on it. 

The Eiffel Threads are launched from C. The synchronization is done from Eiffel. The shared bank account is a C structure, and is updated by the Eiffel Threads using some C externals. 

<br/>
In main. c: <br/>
LISTSZ size of bank account history. <br/>
DEPOSITORS numbers of savers. <br/>
WITHDRAWERS numbers of spenders. 
<br/>



A typical output will be:
<code>
$ bank_account
