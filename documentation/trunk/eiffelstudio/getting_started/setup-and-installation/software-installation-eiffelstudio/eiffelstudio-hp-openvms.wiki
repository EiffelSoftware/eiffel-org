==Checking your environment==

EiffelStudio requires GTK+ 1.2.10 or above to function properly. You can check that you have this installed correctly by typing the following command:
<code>gtk-config --version</code>
The command should succeed and the version number of GTK+ should appear. If it is not 1.2.10 or above then you cannot continue the installation of EiffelStudio. You first need to install GTK+ 1.2.10.

==Installing the Enterprise Edition==

===From the Web===

After downloading the '''eifXXvms.zip''' installation package (where XX stands for the EiffelStudio version number), unzip the distribution into temp:[dir] where where temp:[dir] is the location of a temporary directory:
<code>unzip eifXXvms.zip temp:[dir]</code>

And use the following commands to install the files into eiffel_installation_path where eiffel_installation_path is a device:[directory] on an ODS-5 volume:
<code>set file/attrib=(org:seq,rfm:fix,lrl:9216) temp:[dir]eifXXvms.save
backup temp:[dir]eifXXvms.save/save eiffel_installation_path</code>

===From a CD===

You must mount the installation CD-ROM volume with the following qualifier:
<code>mount cd_dev:/media_format=cdrom/undefined_fat=fixed:cr:9216</code>

where cd_dev: is the CD-ROM device. And use the following commands to install the files into eiffel_installation_path where eiffel_installation_path is a device:[directory] on an ODS-5 volume:
<code>backup cd_dev:[000000]eifXXvms.save/save eiffel_installation_path</code>

===Completing the installation===

You must define a system-wide rooted logical name to reference the installation directory, for instance:
<code>define/system EIFFELXX eiffel_installation_path:[directory.] /trans=conceal</code>

To use EiffelStudio for OpenVMS, run the setup procedure to define the environment: 
<code>@eiffel_installation_path:[000000]setup</code>
This will define the logical names and DCL symbols required to run Eiffel.

Once the files are copied and once the environment is setup up set, you need to register EiffelStudio. To do so type the following command:
<code>RUN ISE_EIFFEL:[000000]register</code>

A dialog asking for your '''Username''' and '''CD Key''' should appear as it does below:

<center> [[Image:56--unix-setup|Setup dialog]] </center>

Enter the information located inside the box that contains your copy of the EiffelStudio Enterprise Edition. Once the information is correct, the '''Register''' button will be enabled. Click '''Register''' to actually register EiffelStudio.

The first time you launch EiffelStudio, you will be asked for an activation key through the following dialog:

<center> [[Image:56--unix-registration|Registration dialog]] </center>

By clicking on the [http://activate.eiffel.com http://activate.eiffel.com]  URL, a new web browser will appear with the requested fields automatically filled in with the appropriate information. Simply click '''Activate''' and a new page with an activation code will appear. Copy and paste the activation code in the first field and the '''Activate''' button should be enabled to let you activate your copy.

You can activate your copy up to three times. Once you have reached this threshold and need to reinstall your copy, contact Eiffel Software to request one more activation.

If no web broswer appears, it is most likely because netscape is not installed on your machine or is not in your path. Instead you should manually launch a new web browser and go to the page [http://activate.eiffel.com http://activate.eiffel.com]  and enter the information manually. Then follow the above instructions as if the browser had been properly launched.

You may receive the following dialog when launching EiffelStudio:

<center> [[Image:56--unix-registration-error|Registration incomplete]] </center>

This probably means that the '''register''' program was not launched or did not succeed in storing data to the following file ISE_EIFFEL:[install.limand].ec_license. To solve this, rerun the '''register''' program with a user account that has permissions to write at ISE_EIFFEL:[install.limand] and enter your '''Username''' and '''CD Key'''.

Once this is done you can jump to the next section "Using EiffelStudio."
