In both trees of the [[Object tool|object tool]], objects are displayed. The values displayed for each object fall into two categories: the object's attributes (grouped under the '''attributes''' folder  [[Image:feature-attribute-icon]]  ) and its once routines (grouped under the '''once routines''' folder  [[Image:feature-once-icon]]  ). 

The following symbol scheme is used to categorize each item:
*   [[Image:debugger-object-immediate-icon]]  An attribute of a basic Eiffel type, such as [[ref:libraries/base/reference/kernel/integer_chart.xml|INTEGER]] or [[ref:libraries/base/reference/kernel/classic/double_chart.xml|DOUBLE]] 
*   [[Image:debugger-object-eiffel-icon]]  An attribute that is a reference to an object 
*   [[Image:debugger-object-void-icon]]  A Void reference 
*   [[Image:debugger-object-expanded-icon]]  An object that is expanded 

For .NET system, special symbols are used to describe :
*   [[Image:debugger-object-dotnet-icon]]  An object that is external (i.e., not known as an Eiffel type) 
*   [[Image:debugger-object-dotnet-static-icon]]  A static value object that is external (i.e., not known as an Eiffel type) 
*   [[Image:debugger-object-static-icon]]  A static value object that is known as an Eiffel type
