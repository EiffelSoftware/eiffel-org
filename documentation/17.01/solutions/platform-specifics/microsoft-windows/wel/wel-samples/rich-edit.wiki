==Compiling==

To compile the example: 
* Launch EiffelStudio. 
* Click '''Add project'''
* Browse to ''$ISE_EIFFEL\examples\wel\richedit\''. 
* Choose ''richedit.ecf''
* Choose the location where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the configuration file. 
* Click '''OK'''. 

==Running==

After launching the program, a window will be displayed as shown above. The program is a simple text editor which allows you to load and save files; select fonts and colors; and print files. The operations are accessible through the menu bar and/or the tool bar.

==Under the Hood==

Both the menu items and the tool bar buttons are handled by on_menu_command which has been redefined in MAIN_WINDOW.

Four of the [[stddlgs cluster|standard dialogs]]  provided by WEL are used to receive input from the user. 
This sample contains the following classes: 
* APPLICATION_IDS
* MAIN_WINDOW
* RICHEDIT_DEMO
