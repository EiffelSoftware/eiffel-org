The Quick Reference to the Eiffel programming language provides an informal guide to the syntax and reserved words of the language. The Eiffel programming language is described in detail in the ISO/ECMA standard document, available [http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-367.htm online].  

Sometimes there are differences between the language as defined by the standard and that which is implemented by Eiffel Software. These differences are documented in the online documentation.

So, the final authority on Eiffel as implemented by Eiffel Software is the content of the standard document, amended by those variances cited in the [[Differences between standard ECMA-367 and Eiffel Software implementation|"differences" chapter of the online documentation]]. 

This reference is based on the June 2006 ISO/ECMA standard document.
